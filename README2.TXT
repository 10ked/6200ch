6200ch Firewire Cable Box Channel Changer

I just added in support for DCX3200M stb,
compiled it and tryed it out on my slackware 14.1
mythtv-27.4 system and it works. Going to have to edit 
firewiredevice.cpp as well. Sorry if i seem a bit new at 
this because i am. It wasn't that hard to do though
even though i don't code.
